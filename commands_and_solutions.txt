IMPORTANT: The directories and files used here are all make believe. Don’t use them for anything other than what's given here.

From your terminal program, change the current directory of your shell so that it is in the CISC220_A1 directory. This directory contains several subdirectories organized like so:

│   │   └── images
│   ├── A2
│   ├── A3
│   ├── A4

│   └── A6
├── classlist
├── lectures
├── marking
│   └── A1
